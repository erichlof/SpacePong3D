Additional Notes
--------------------------------
Network play: <br>
Click in the bottom-left corner text field, and enter a player name.  Then click the "Join Lobby" button.  Now open up another instance of SpacePong3D in another tab or window and do the same with a different player name.  You should see the names of all players in the lobby appear on the right side of the window.  Click on a player's name to ask them permission to play.  Then go to the other window and click on the asking player's name to accept a match.  Now you can play network pong in 3D!

TODO: <br>
I haven't touched this game in a while and since then, the three.js graphics library that it uses has evolved quite a bit.  I will try to re-work some of SpacePong3D's rendering code so that it will work correctly with the latest version of the three.js library.  Also, I have improved the mouse/mobile joystick code for my current games that I'm working on, so I will also try to update this game with those changes.  <br>

Known Issues: <br>
In rare occasions during network play, the ball freezes in the middle of the playing arena and you can't continue.  I haven't tracked this bug down yet.  This was my first game written for the web using HTML, JavaScript and three.js WebGL graphics.  It was more of testing ground for getting a game up and running from start to finish, but I'm pretty pleased with my first effort.  Check out my other games listed above to see how my web 3D game programming has evolved.  :)
